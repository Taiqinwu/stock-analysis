# Stock-Analysis
* performed a stock-analysis with VBA

## Overview of Project
* Steve obtained a list of stock market in year 2017 and 2018, and we want to create a Macro that can perform stock analysis on entire stock market over a year for steve. 

### Purpose
* The purpose of this project is to create Macro can generate a report that shows an analysis in total daily voumne in a year and annual return percentage for each tickers. We also wanted to refactored the code so it runs much faster because Steve can run the analysis faster if he has a longer list of stock market. 

## Result
### Stock Performance Between 2017 and 2018
* In 2017, majority of the stocks on the list will have a positive return in investment. The stock ticker DQ and SEDG performed outstanding in 2017, with a 199.4% annual return for DQ and 184.5% annual return for SEDG. In current year, we noted the total daily volume does not have much connection with the annual return.

* In 2018, majority of the stocks on the list will have a negative return in investment. Steven has to be careful with his investment. There are only two ticker that have a postive return, which is ENPH with a 81.9% of return and RUN with a 84% of return. In current year, we noted higher total dily volumne might be a factore for stocks to have a positive return rate.
